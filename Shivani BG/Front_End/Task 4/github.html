       <b>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system 
           designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
            with speed and efficiency.
            <br>
            <br>

        Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
         It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase 
         with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas,
          and multiple workflows..<br/> <br/>
